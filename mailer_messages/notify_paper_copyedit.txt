Subject: PROJECT_NAME cannot create an egalley for "FILENAME_SPLIT" (paper-copyedit)

PROJECT_NAME checked all editions in Biblio associated with your file, "FILENAME_SPLIT".
None of the 'typeset from' values for this work indicate copyedit based on a Macmillan-styled Word file.

Consequently PROJECT_NAME assumes this to be a traditional paper copyedit, and cannot create an egalley for "FILENAME_SPLIT".

If your file IS styled with Macmillan Word Styles, and you would like an egalley created, please email us at workflows@macmillan.com.
If this is a paper copyedit, and would still like to have an egalley created for this manuscript, please reach out to the ebooks team directly:
ebook.production@macmillanusa.com

The submitted original file can be found in the "PROJECT_NAME/OUT" Macmillan Dropbox folder.
