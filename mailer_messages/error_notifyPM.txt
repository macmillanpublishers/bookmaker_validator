Subject: egalleymaker update: FILENAME_SPLIT

Hi PMNAME!

We were keeping an eye on egalleymaker, and noticed that your file "FILENAME_SPLIT" ran into some errors. We're taking a look now and will get back to you ASAP with info on whether or not you need to order an egalley. Thanks for your patience!

Best,
The Workflows team
